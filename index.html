          Over the summer, I made a game for my AP CS class. In the game, you
          control the Scratch Cat with your mouse, as you attempt to dodge the
          bus. This was my favorite thing I made for my assigned Summer HW. I
          had real trouble deciding on the exact time in which the bus moves,
          but I worked through it to produce what I think is a pretty fun game.

          Recently, we have been assigned to create a pixelated image. The goal
          was to create a 16x16 image of your choice using hex code coloring. It
          was cool to be creative, but I had real trouble finding the correct
          colors to use, but after I got over that hurdle, I learned the hex and
          created my image.

          In AP CS, we have created the start of a drawing app program. We
          created the program using pair programming. What I screenshotted is V1
          of the app, and we look to add the GUI of our app. It was a real
          challenge implementing the GUI, but now we understand and look to
          update the app for V2.

        <p>
          In AP CS, we have made steps to finalizing our Drawing App with the
          updated version of the drawing app program. What I screenshotted is
          the V2 of the app. We expanded on the gui of our app as well as adding
          more accesibility to the key functions such as "erase."

        <p>
          For this project, I created an LED stoplight simulation. The goal was
          to control LEDs in order to display red, yellow, in green, in the
          specific order of a normal traffic light. This project was basically
          my introduction to Raspberry Pi and it was pretty fun and a good
          challenge.

          Over the summer, I made a game for my AP CS class. In the game, you
          control the Scratch Cat with your mouse, as you attempt to dodge the
          bus. This was my favorite thing I made for my assigned Summer HW. I
          had real trouble deciding on the exact time in which the bus moves,
          but I worked through it to produce what I think is a pretty fun game.

          Recently, we have been assigned to create a pixelated image. The goal was to create a 16x16 image of your choice using hex code coloring. It was cool to be creative, but I had real trouble finding the correct colors to use, but after I got over that hurdle, I learned the hex and created my image.  </p>

          In AP CS, we have created the start of a drawing app program. We created the program using pair programming. What I screenshotted is V1 of the app, and we look to add the gui of our app. It was a real challenge implementing the gui, but now we understand and look to update the app for V2.
